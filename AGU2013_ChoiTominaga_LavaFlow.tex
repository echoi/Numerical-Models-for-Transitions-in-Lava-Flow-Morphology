We numerically investigate the effects of variations in slope angle on the morphological transition of submarine lava flow. GALE, an open-source code for long-term geodynamic modeling, has been adapted to submarine lava flow simulations. Using the adapted GALE, we first numerically reproduce pillow lavas as accumulated tubular flows, the dominant formation process observed in nature. We then test whether an increase in slope angle causes the sheet-to-pillow transition. This specific morphological transition has been observed while the existing theory and analogue models for lava flow morphology predict the opposite. The combined effects of a slope angle change and other lava source parameters (e.g., effusion rate) on lava morphology are also modeled. Finally, the model results and performance of the adapted GALE are benchmarked against pTatin3d, a finite element marker-and-cell based library developed for studying large deformation processes of very viscous fluids.

      $\diamond$ Dimensional analysis of solidifying flows with constant effusion rate gives two independent dimensionless parameters \citep{Fink1990}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Normalized temperature: $\Theta_{s}=(T_{s}-T_{a})/(T_{l}-T_{a})$ where $T_{l}$ is the temperature of lava, $T_{s}$ is the solidification temperature and $T_{a}$ is the ambient temperature.
        \item Modified P\'{e}clet number: $Pe=UH/\kappa$, where $U$ is the lateral velocity scale, $H$ is the depth scale and $\kappa$ is the heat diffusivity.
      \end{itemize}
      $\diamond$ More importantly, these two parameters can be combined into one, $\Psi$:
      %\vspace{-1em}
      \setlength{\abovedisplayskip}{0em}
      \setlength{\belowdisplayskip}{0em}
      \[ \Psi = t_{s}/t_{a},\]
      where $t_{s}$ is time for the onset of solidification of an element of lava after brought into contact with the environment and $t_{a}$ is timescale for lateral advection of viscous fluid in the absence of cooling.

``As a broad lobe encounters a steep slope, the gravitational forces increase the tension on the solid crust, causing the lobe to break apart into smaller `fingers' of lava. Conservation of mass dictates that the effusion rate of a small part of a lobe be less than the effusion rate of the entire lobe, so pillows are more likely to be generated as the lava flow breaks into smaller units.'' \citep{Gregg2003}.

         \begin{equation*}
            \eta(T,\phi) = \eta_{0} (1.0-\phi/\phi_{max})^{-2.5}\exp[ -\gamma(T_{e}-T) ],
            \label{eq:basalt viscosity}
         \end{equation*}
         where $\eta_{0}$ is the reference viscosity (50 Pa$\cdot$s) at the vent temperatre, $T_{e}$ (=1100 $^{\circ}$C), $\phi_{max}$ is the maximum crystal fraction ($\sim$0.68) that allows flow and $\gamma$ is a constant (0.04). 

       \item The volume fraction of crystal, $\phi$:
       \begin{equation*}
          \phi(T) = \phi_{0} + \phi_{f}(T_{e}-T)/(T_{e}-T_{s}),
       \end{equation*}
       where $\phi_{0}$ is the initial crystal fraction at vent, which is zero, $\phi_{f}$ is the further increment during flow satisfying $\phi_{0}+\phi_{f} = \phi_{max}$ and $T_{s}$ is the solidus (600 $^{\circ}$C). According to the above two expressions, viscosity grows from $\sim$10 Pa$\cdot$s to 10$^{5}$ Pa$\cdot$s as temperature decreases to the ambient value (0 $^{\circ}$C). 

       \item Drucker-Prager plasticity: With internal friction angle set to be zero, only cohesion-like yield stress ($S_{y}$) is set to be temperature-dependent, reflecting the cooling effect \citep{Miyamoto1998}:

  \item More careful benchmarking needs to be designed.
  \item Besides the validation of results, it turned out to be difficult to identify lava flow morphology in 2D models.
